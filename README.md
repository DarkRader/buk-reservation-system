## Abstract
This Bachelor’s thesis focuses on the development of a reservation system for
the Buben Club, located in the Bubeneč dormitory. The thesis covers an
analysis of existing solutions, system requirements, technology selection, application design, 
implementation, testing, and documentation. Potential future
developments are outlined, and an evaluation of the achieved results is provided. The system automates 
the reservation process for club members, allowing them to authenticate via the club’s 
information system and book available rooms. The design minimizes manual intervention, ensuring that reservation
approvals—such as those required for night reservations or reservations exceeding allowed capacity—are 
handled directly within the application. The backend is developed using FastAPI and integrates with the Google Calendar
API for managing reservations. The system is also connected to an access
control system, enabling members to enter reserved rooms using their access
cards instead of physical keys. Reservation rules are enforced based on user
roles within the club. As a result of this thesis, a functional web application
was developed, significantly streamlining the room reservation process for club
members, reducing administrative overhead, and improving user experience.
