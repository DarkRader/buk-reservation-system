\ctufitabstractCZE{Tato bakalářská práce se zaměřuje na vývoj rezervačního systému pro klub Buben, který se nachází na koleji Bubeneč. Práce zahrnuje analýzu existujících řešení, systémové požadavky, výběr technologií, návrh aplikace, implementaci, testování a dokumentaci. Jsou nastíněny možné budoucí rozšíření a provedeno vyhodnocení dosažených výsledků. Systém automatizuje proces rezervace pro členy klubu, umožňuje jejich autentizaci prostřednictvím informačního systému klubu a rezervaci dostupných místností. Návrh minimalizuje nutné ruční zásahy a zajišťuje, že schvalování rezervací—například v případě nočních rezervací nebo rezervací překračujících povolenou kapacitu—probíhá přímo v aplikace. Backend je vyvinut pomocí FastAPI a je integrován s Google Calendar API pro správu rezervací. Systém je rovněž propojen s přístupovým systémem, který členům umožňuje vstup do rezervovaných místností pomocí jejich přístupových karet namísto fyzických klíčů. Pravidla pro rezervace jsou aplikována na základě rolí uživatelů v rámci klubu. Výsledkem této práce je funkční webová aplikace, která výrazně zjednodušuje proces rezervace místností pro členy klubu, snižuje administrativní zátěž a zlepšuje uživatelskou zkušenost.}
\ctufitabstractENG{This Bachelor’s thesis focuses on the development of a reservation system for the Buben Club, located in the Bubeneč dormitory. The thesis covers an analysis of existing solutions, system requirements, technology selection, application design, implementation, testing, and documentation. Potential future developments are outlined, and an evaluation of the achieved results is provided. The system automates the reservation process for club members, allowing them to authenticate via the club’s information system and book available rooms. The design minimizes manual intervention, ensuring that reservation approvals—such as those required for night reservations or reservations exceeding allowed capacity—are handled directly within the application. The backend is developed using FastAPI and integrates with the Google Calendar API for managing reservations. The system is also connected to an access control system, enabling members to enter reserved rooms using their access cards instead of physical keys. Reservation rules are enforced based on user roles within the club. As a result of this thesis, a functional web application was developed, significantly streamlining the room reservation process for club members, reducing administrative overhead, and improving user experience.}
